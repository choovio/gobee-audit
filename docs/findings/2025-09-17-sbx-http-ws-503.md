# SBX: http-adapter/ws-adapter 503s during health check

**Date:** 2025-09-17  
**Context:** SBX cluster; pods http-adapter-*, ws-adapter-* pending/503 in /health.  
**Observation:** STATUS.md + pods matrix show adapters Pending and /health returning 503.  
**Impact:** External HTTP/WS ingress unstable for SBX.  
**Hypothesis:** Image/repo drift + ECR image mismatch for adapters; pending scheduling on node pools.  
**Action taken:** Recorded full pods -> image matrix; tagged snapshot udit-20250917-094511.  
**Follow-ups:**  
- Verify adapter images/tags in ECR vs manifests (Owner: Farhad, Due: 2025-09-18)  
- Add runbook: “Adapter image sync + redeploy”.
